            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-29">Jan 29, 2025</time>
            <p>This <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a> provided a great explanation of when and how to best implement modal windows. Because users have been trained to close models, and due to a general lack of trust with pop-ups on websites, all components of a modal must be designed intentionally in order to not dissuade the user from continuing to use the website. Certain practices like the location of the exit button (x) and being able to use the escape button to exit must be used as that is the common practice the users will expect. Additionally, modals must be a result of a user's action, so it is clear the modal is something necessary that they caused, rather than a random pop-up that may appear suspicious. The intention of the modal must be clear and easy to navigate. Finally, the modal window must be accessible to all users in terms of appearance and navigation.</p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-21">Jan 21, 2025</time>
            <p>Something that has become increasingly apparent to me as I’ve learned more about UI/UX design is that you may not notice when a site is designed well, but you definitely will see when it is designed poorly. Most users have experience with many websites and are used to similar practices implemented universally. Because of this, we may not even think about how important the position of the label is, or why it’s so important to show users how much progress they’ve made in the form. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This article</a> was a great reminder of practices that I’m used to, but maybe I have never considered how crucial they are, and would then maybe forget to use them myself. </p>
            <p>An application that implements these practices well in its forms is <a href="https://www.depop.com/?utm_source=Brand%20SEM&utm_medium=paid%20advertising&utm_campaign=PAID_GG_US_PRO_SEARCH_ALL_BRAND-CORE-DEFENCE&utm_content=depop&gad_source=1&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.depop.com%2F%3Futm_source%3DBrand%2520SEM%26utm_medium%3Dpaid%2520advertising%26utm_campaign%3DPAID_GG_US_PRO_SEARCH_ALL_BRAND-CORE-DEFENCE%26utm_content%3Ddepop%26gad_source%3D1&~ad_set_id=169727004149&~campaign_id=21880045407&~channel=Brand%20SEM&~keyword=Paid%20Search&~placement&~campaign=PAID_GG_US_PRO_SEARCH_ALL_BRAND-CORE-DEFENCE&~feature=paid%20advertising&gclid=Cj0KCQiAqL28BhCrARIsACYJvkeU_rQSFOn5Xj7ZQ29Vxdi5oVp1T4svQ-V1YyGbDjeUbC_43N-dwIoaAmHNEALw_wcB&_branch_match_id=1150321348495087273">Depop</a>. To set up a seller account, you must provide a lot of sensitive info such as your bank account number (so they can deposit the money you make into your account). The form provides explanations when it requests this information to assure the user that it’s legitimate and necessary. </p>
