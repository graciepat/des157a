            <h2>Meet Cozy Crew Whale</h2>
            <p>This silly whale is the most recent addition to my Jellycat collection, and has definitely become one of my favorites. He was gifted to me by my amazing friend for my 21st birthday. I love how it makes zero sense that he has a sweater on because he's a whale!</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Tomato</h2>
            <p>This tomato is probably my favorite Jellycat I own, and also my very first! My boyfriend got this one for me from Newsbeat downtown, and ever since acquiring this perfectly round and adorable tomato, my love for Jellycats has only grown.</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Brie</h2>
            <p>Brie was a christmas gift from my mom who "went on to the Jellycat site and couldn't resist putting every cute one in her cart". I like to think that Brie and Bread were meant to go together. You will never find Brie sitting on my bed without Bread by her side.</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Succulents</h2>
            <p>These silly plants are the perfect solution for an aspiring plant mom who can't keep her plants alive. You can find these two sitting on my window sill "photosynthesizing" of course. I can't wait to continue to grow my little garden of Jellycat plants.</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Hearts</h2>
            <p>These two are my favorite dynamic duo and I love how they're total opposites. The little red heart is giving little fuzzy monstor while the white heart is just... there. But love them both of course. The little red monster heart was from my wonderful friend who was my "secret santa" for our second year of our Jellycat exchange.</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Bread</h2>
            <p>Another amazing christmas gift from my amazing mom. She was so wise to gift Brie and Bread together cause they need each other! I love this silly slice and I feel very compelled to purchase other bakery items now...</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Cloud</h2>
            <p>This fluffy cloud was from my roommates first (hopefully of many) Jellycat exchange! Funny enough, there were two clouds gifted during that exchange. We named them Claude and Claudette of course.</p>

            <h2>Meet Amuseable Happy Boiled Egg</h2>
            <p>I honestly do not have a lot to stay about this egg except that he is so very cute, so happy, and I love how Jellycat has created so many variations of him (ex. bride and groom, graduation, nerd, etc.).</p>
